# Preface {.unnumbered}

This collection presents the diary of Thomas Russell as evidence of a first-hand account of colonial enterprise, domestic anxiety, and environmental abundance on the north-western edge of British North America in 1870–71. 

The Ladysmith Historical Society has approached the document with a simple conviction—that modest, workaday records often illuminate the past more clearly than official reports or retrospective memoirs.The Society’s research situates the diary within its familial, commercial and political contexts, while resisting the temptation to smooth its rough edges. Russell’s language reflects the attitudes of his time, including assumptions about Indigenous peoples that are now rightly challenged. Yet his observations—of labour, scarcity, dishonesty, mutual dependence and natural plenitude—remain indispensable.

Russell was neither explorer nor politician. He was a middle-aged shopkeeper turned mine superintendent, dispatched to the Queen Charlotte Islands at a moment when speculative capital, fragile logistics and imperial assumptions collided with geography and human reality. His diary, written for his wife rather than posterity, is therefore unguarded. It records exhaustion, moral judgement, affection, fear and frustration with equal candour. In doing so, it captures the texture of colonial life more vividly than many formal archives.
