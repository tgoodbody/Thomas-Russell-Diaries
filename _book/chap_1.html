<p>Thomas Russell was born in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rgG8M9sDhZXT7ko86">Haddington, Scotland</a> in 1836 to parents Robert Russell and Agnes Russell née Cameron. At age 16, travelling in steerage aboard the Norman Morison (a Hudson Bay Company supply ship that made annual journeys between England and Victoria between 1849 and 1853 under Captain David D. Wishart), Thomas set sail on August 14th 1852 from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jinj9g22YGjC7K7R8">Gravesend, England</a> and after travelling around <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BnrCK75v5RSMSmn66">Cape Horn</a> arrived in Royal Roads, Fort Victoria, on Sunday January 16th 1853.</p>

<p>Thomas was the brother in law of Kenneth McKenzie who had been contracted by the Puget Sound Agricultural Company (PSAC) – a subsidiary of the Hudson Bay Company - to set up a farm, Craigflower, near Maple Point between Esquimalt Harbour and The Gorge, north of Victoria.</p>
<p>Thomas was a listed as a labourer amongst McKenzie’s employees, and was bound by a five year contract with the PSAC. However, he was obviously not working class and was apparently well educated. When Governor James Douglas seconded Robert Barr, who had originally been intended to teach school at Craigflower, for the Victoria School teacher position, McKenzie recommended Thomas as schoolmaster for Craigflower: Thomas, however, did not accept the position, choosing instead to work at Craigflower Farm assisting McKenzie with running the bakery, butchery and flour mill. The farm supplied the Navy at Esquimalt with much of its meat, bread and vegetable needs.</p>
<p>Thomas remained working with McKenzie after his five-year contract with the PSAC expired in 1857.</p>
<p>In March 1859 Thomas married an English woman, Sarah Collier (variably spelled Sarah or Sara), who had come to Vancouver Island in 1857 on the HBC ship Princess Royal.</p>

<p>The couple’s first child, Alice Marion, was born April 22nd, 1860.</p>
<p>Indications are that Thomas Russell planned not to renew his contract with the Puget Sound Agricultural Company in 1862 as in 1861 he agreed to accept, in lieu of the twenty-five acres of land to which he became entitled in 1857 on the expiry of his five years contract of service with the company, two parcels of land in the vicinity of Craigflower consisting of one 3-acre lot adjacent to the school reserve and a larger 19-acre section bounded by the Colquitz River to the north, A factor which would have influenced Thomas in this decision was that his brother-in-law Kenneth McKenzie had not had his contract with the PSAC as Craigflower bailiff renewed in 1861.</p>
<p>It appears that after 1861 Thomas continued to assist McKenzie in the management of contracts for supplying baked goods, beef and vegetables to British naval vessels anchored at Esquimalt.</p>
<p>Thomas and Sarah’s second child, Catherine, was born March 4th 1862. This was followed on March 7th 1865 with the birth of a son, Robert Henry.</p>

<p>In May 1865 Thomas Russell agreed to fill the vacant position of schoolmaster at Craigflower School, the incumbent, Henry Claypole, having resigned.</p>
<p>Thomas’ tenure as schoolteacher at Craigflower was brief – just over a year. His performance as a teacher appears to have been significantly better than that of his predecessor, Mr.&nbsp;Claypole. At the yearly examination on July 19th 1865, parents commented that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“their children have learnt more in two months than in a year before with Mr.&nbsp;Claypole.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in June 1866 the Superintendent of the Board of Education called the attention of the Board to the difference between the $1000 annual salary that Thomas Russell was receiving as schoolmaster at Craigflower with that of the other teachers in the country districts at $500, stating at the same time that Thomas’ efficiency was more than doubtful. The Board unanimously resolved that to secure both efficiency in the Craigflower School and economy in the general expenditure, the present assistant teacher in the Fort Street boys’ school in Victoria be moved to Craigflower at a salary of $750 and that Thomas Russell’s services be dispensed with. In July 1866, despite favourable results in the annual examinations of the Craigflower students, the Superintendent reported to the Board of Education that Thomas Russell was to be discharged in preference to Mr.&nbsp;Nicholson for being by far the least efficient and having had no training as a teacher, and that the usual notice of one month be given him.</p>
<p>The Board appears not to have acted quickly on this as, possibly having gotten wind of his impending termination and not having been paid for the month of September, Thomas Russell in a surprise move on October 3rd penned his resignation to the Colonial Secretary, discharged the children and informed the parents that the school was closing. The Superintendent explained to the Board that he had only received Russell’s letter on October 8th, and that Mr.&nbsp;Russell had left his position to open a grocery store in Victoria without the slightest indication to the Board.</p>
<p>The rancour between Russell and The Board of Education appears to have continued as when, in July 1867 Thomas claimed his month’s salary as Teacher at Craigflower for September 1866, the Board declined to recognize any claim.</p>

<p>Thomas Russell’s Victoria grocery store backed on to the backyard of the Bank of British North America (demolished in 1949) on Yates Street. The building he was in was two-story and ‘The Colonist’ printed their newspaper upstairs.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck the family Sept 7th 1869 when his 4 year old son, Robert Henry, died. This death touched Thomas deeply, and his diary is replete with sorrowful references to his little boy.</p>
<p>In 1870 Thomas moved his store to the corner of Blanshard and Fort Streets. Early in the morning of July 15th tragedy struck again when it burned to the ground with total loss, leaving him unable to save even his books.</p>

<p>It is not recorded what employment Russell did immediately upon returning to Victoria from the Queen Charlotte Islands in May 1871. Possibly he commenced working as a book keeper or accountant. He held the position of Assessor and Collector of Taxes for the City of Victoria from 1873 until 1902 , and from that year until 1912 he was book-keeper for Thorpe &amp; Co.&nbsp;of Victoria, soda water and soft drinks manufacturers.</p>

<p>The gravestone shows evidence of having been broken as there is a large crack across it. A later footstone added to the monument is carved with the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This grave was restored by the daughters of Thomas Michael son of Alice Michael the only child of Thomas and Sara Russell to live to adulthood. The Russells were pioneer settlers at Craigflower. The stone once stood in Pioneer Square”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inscription on the main stone reads:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>IN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE <br> of <br> ROBERT HENRY <br> Only Son of <br> T. &amp; S. RUSSELL <br> Died at Victoria Sept 7th 1869 <br> Aged 4 Years and 5 months <br> <br> Also <br> CATHERINE <br> Their Younger Daughter <br> Born March 4th 1862 <br> Died December 7th 1880</p>
</div>
<section id="solving-a-grave-mystery" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solving-a-grave-mystery">Solving a grave mystery</h2>
<p>There is a complex history to where the children were buried. Robert Henry (died 1869) was initially interred in the Old Burying Ground (now Pioneer Square) and his ‘Lamb of God’ headstone erected on his grave there.</p>
<p>Ross Bay Cemetery records indicate that he was later exhumed from the Old Burial ground and reburied in Ross Bay Cemetery Plot H72W12. Catherine was initially buried in Ross Bay Cemetery Plot H72W18.</p>
<p>Possibly after Sarah’s death in 1905 (she is buried in Ross Bay Cemetery Plot H73W18), the remains of both children were exhumed and reburied in Plot H74W18, beside their mother’s resting place. Catherine’s inscription on the gravestone possibly dates from that time. It appears that when Thomas (died 1912) he was buried in the same plot as the bones of his children, but no stone or inscription marks his resting place.</p>
<p>So three of the four Thomas Russell family members lie together in Ross Bay Cemetery.</p>
