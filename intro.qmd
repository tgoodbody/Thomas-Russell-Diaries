## Provenance of the diary {#sec-provenance-of-the-diary}

In September 2024 Michael Gould, a Ladysmith, Vancouver Island resident called in to the Ladysmith Archives with two hand bags full of family papers he wanted to find a home for.

Amongst the documents and family photographs were four notebooks bundled together with twine. On inspection, these were a daily diary written by Thomas Russell, great great grandfather of Michael Gould, chronicling his seven and a half month sojourn superintending a coal mine in Skidegate Inlet, Queen Charlotte islands (now called Haida Gwaii) in 1870/1.

The diary, consisting of four notebook volumes, had been handed down through the generations within the Michael family via Thomas’ daughter Alice, who had moved to Cedar to teach school and who subsequently married Edward Duncan Michael, a settler farmer, in May 1884.

Volumes 1 to 3 of the diary are of identical type, notebooks with dark maroon soft covers. The text inside is written in ink and chronicles Thomas’ journey up to the Queen Charlotte Islands from Victoria aboard the sloop ‘Thornton’ and the bulk of his stay in Skidegate Inlet.

Volume 4 is a notebook of different make and size with a light brown faux leather cover. The text inside is written in pencil. In addition to containing the daily work records of the mine employees, this volume chronicles a harrowing return canoe trip Thomas took from Skidegate Inlet to Masset in search of provisions toward the end of their stay. It appears that Thomas did not wish to risk getting the ink-written Volume 3 of his diary wet while making this trip – as numerous blank pages remain in that notebook.

## Contents of the diary

As Thomas explains in his introduction, he wrote the diary for his wife Sarah, so that she would be able to understand what he had been experiencing during the six months he spent in the Queen Charlottes away from his family which remained in Victoria. It is obvious from his writing that the Russell family was very close, made closer perhaps by their grief over losing their son, Robert Henry, at age 4 in 1869. The diary is replete with references to his little boy and with Thomas’ longing to be with his family.

The diary reads almost like an adventure novel with near shipwreck, horrendous accidents and injuries, bush medicine, interactions with the Haida First Nation, whites and orientals, scurrilous and honorable individuals, shoddy and dishonest work by previous company employees, a complex and thin coal deposit,  running out of supplies, and perilous dugout canoe journeys. 

References to the numerous whales, whaling activities, abundant salmon and dogfish populations seen on the trip up from Victoria to the Queen Charlottes on the sloop ‘Thornton’ provide insight into the natural abundance of the Gulf of Georgia (called the Salish Sea now) prior to late 19th century devastation through colonial overharvesting. 
Despite his perhaps inevitable colonial attitude toward First Nations, Thomas shows himself to be devout, respectful of honesty and very critical (almost to the point of despair) of dishonesty and immorality.

Thomas never states why he took the job of Superintendent of the coal mine in Skidegate Inlet. The work was not familiar to him and he may not have known that the mining company was in financial difficulties before he left Victoria. It is very likely that he was driven to take the work through desperation after his grocery store in Victoria burned down July 15th 1870 with total loss.

What Thomas encountered when he got to the mine appalled him. Previous workers had operated in a sloppy manner, not bothering to separate coal from slack, with the mine and tramway bringing the coal to the shipping wharf in poor and dangerous condition. The struggle to put together a load of 600 tons of coal before a ship arrived fills much of the narrative. Beset by accidents, horrendous injuries, a thin and complex coal seam, disgruntled employees and theft of key supplies, the ship arrived but had to be sent away with a short cargo. Thomas was glad to see it go, however, due to the scurrilous nature of the captain whose actions threatened his relationship with the Haida people. 

As if troubles at the mine weren’t enough, the supply of ‘key’ comforts such as sugar and coffee ran out  and caused much grumbling amongst the men.  Exacerbating this, the ship coming to relieve them was a month late, causing the group to run out of supplies. This necessitated two largely unsuccessful canoe trips to seek out food – one to the Hudson’s Bay store near the village of Cumshewa, the other an epic journey up the east coast of Graham Island to the Hudson Bay Company depot at Masset.

Thomas’ diary ends with the note 

> “Monday 8th May. Left Queen Charlotte tonight at 6.00 o’clock P.M.”

As reported in an article on page 3  of the May 15th 1871 edition of the Victoria Daily Standard, Thomas and his party were picked up by the HBC steamship ‘Otter’ on its return leg during one of its regular trips up the BC coast.

What is not mentioned in the diary is that at the time of Thomas’ return to Victoria, the Queen Charlotte Coal Mining Company Ltd. was in liquidation. One final disaster upon Thomas was averted by  the Supreme Court of British Columbia (which was ruling on the liquidation of the company) approving a special application made in June 1871 by a Mr. Johnson to ensure that Thomas’ wages be paid out of the first funds coming into the hands of the liquidators. A similar order was made for Laiken’s wages. What happened to the others who worked at the mine during Thomas’ stay is not recorded.

## Importance of the Diary

Thomas Russell’s diary is an important historical document worthy of provincial, if not national, recognition.

It is an important window into the social and commercial environment of a time in British Columbia’s history when rapid colonial expansion was occurring against a backdrop of extensive First Nations depopulation and associated cultural erosion due to successive pandemics during the 1860s. Rampant whisky trading was aiding this destruction. 

## Where the diary is now

The diary volumes have been scanned and deposited in the Saanich Archives as an addition to significant Russell Family Fonds already there.

## Previous publications about the diary

The Michael family, to who the diaries had been passed, must have loaned them to a reporter is early 1914 as a précis of them was published as a substantial article in the Victoria Daily Times Saturday July 25th 1914 page 11 under the heading 
>Mining Coal In the Queen Charlottes Forty Years Ago; An unusual Record: Interesting Reminiscences Gleaned from Diaries of late Thos. Russell, former City Assessor, Victoria. 

This article was republished as a three part series August 8th (see @fig-005), 15th (see @fig-006) and 22nd (see @fig-007) on page 7 in The Queen Charlotte Islander which styled itself as _‘A Weekly Newspaper Published in the interests of the Settlers, and to promote the development of the Queen Charlotte Islands’_.
